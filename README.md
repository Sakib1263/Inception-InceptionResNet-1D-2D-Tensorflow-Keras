# Inception-Model-Builder-Tensorflow-Keras
Inception Models supported: Inception_v3, Inception_v4, Inception_ResNet_v1, Inception_ResNet_v2  
Inception_v3 is a more efficient version of Inception_v1 (or GoogLeNet) and Inception_v2 (BN-Inception), so they were not implemented.  
Inception_v3 architecture is as follows:
